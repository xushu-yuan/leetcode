# Git

## Basic knowledge
### 1. What is Git
`Distributed Version Control System`
- **Control system**: Store content > code
- **Version control**: Maintaining history of changes
- **Distributed system**: a remote a repository and local repositories in different developers' computer
### 2. git merge v.s git rebase
Both are to integrate changes from one branch into another

Example: feature & main

`git merge` merge main into feature 
    
    git checkout feature
    git merge main

- Create a new "merge commit"
- Current branch will be updated to reflect the merge
- Target branch remains untouched
- More safe and keeps the project history

`git rebase` rebase feature into main

    git checkout feature
    git rebase main

- Moves the entire `feature` branch to begin on the tip of `main` branch 
- Rewrites the project history
- Cleaner project history

**NEVER USE git rebase ON PUBLIC BRANCH**
    
### 3. git fetch v.s git pull
`git fetch` is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta data information from the original yet doesn't do any file transferring. It's more like just checking if there are any changes available

`git pull` = git fetch + git merge

### 4. Explain HEAD
`HEAD` is a special pointer that points to the local branch youâ€™re currently on

## Git Command
`git init`:
- initialize an existing directory as a Git repository

`git clone URL`:
- Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits

`git branch [branch-name]`:
- create a new branch at the current commit

`git checkout -b [branch-name]`:
- create a new branch and switch to it

`git status`:
- what branch you're on; what files are in the working or staging directory, and any other important information

`git add *`
- add files/changes to the next commit

`git commit -m [commit message]`:
- commit staged content

`git diff`:
- diff of what is changed but not staged

`git diff --staged`:
- diff of what is staged but not yet committed

`git stash`:
- save modified and staged changes

`git reset [<mode>] [<commit>]`
- Reset current HEAD to specified state 
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1`: undo the last commit but keeping the changes
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1`: undo the last commit and discard the changes

`git push`: upload local repo to the remote repo
- `git push -u origin [branch]`: Useful when pushing a new branch, this creates an upstream tracking branch with a lasting relationship to your local branch
- `git push --all`: Push all branches
